                <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Yang, a current senior studying Computer Science at Boston College
                I'm a curious life-long learner with experience in web development, deep learning, 
                and software engineering. Currently, I work as a Computer Support Analyst at 
                BC Auxiliary Services. Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis, basketball, and pickleball, 
                powerlifting, and reading about anything from sports to theology. </p>
